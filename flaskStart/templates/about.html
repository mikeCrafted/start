    <div class="about-text">
        This project was intended to help developers get started with new Python Flask projects 
        more quickly by generating some boilerplate code with customizations. Login Systems, Blueprint folder structure etc. were the 
        main focus.
        There is still plenty of room for improvement! Still, even at this stage, it already helps to get started.
